This effect can lead to an inaccurate representation of the \"typical\" or central value of the dataset. The mean is sensitive to outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example: Consider a dataset of household incomes in a small town. Most households have incomes between $30,000 and $50,000 per year, but there is one household with an income of $1,000,000. The mean income for the entire town will be heavily influenced by this outlier, making it appear much higher than the income of the majority of households.\n",

    "\n",
    "# Example: Using the same income dataset as above, the median income would still fall within the $30,000 to $50,000 range, reflecting the income of the majority of households, despite the presence of the outlier.\n",

    "# Mode: The mode represents the most frequent value in the dataset and is generally not influenced by outliers unless the outlier itself is the most frequent value.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example: If the income dataset contains two modes (e.g., $35,000 and $40,000) due to two common income levels in the town, the presence of the outlier will not change the modes unless it happens to be the same as one of the modes.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Measures of Dispersion (Range, Variance, Standard Deviation):\n",
    "\n",
    "# Range: Outliers can significantly affect the range, especially if they are extreme values. The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the dataset, so an outlier that is much larger or smaller than the rest of the data will widen the range.\n",

    "# Example: In a dataset of test scores where most scores range from 60 to 80, the presence of an outlier with a score of 5 or 95 will greatly increase the range.\n",

These measures quantify the spread or dispersion of data points around the mean. Outliers, especially if they are far from the mean, increase the variability and result in larger variance and standard deviation values.\n",
